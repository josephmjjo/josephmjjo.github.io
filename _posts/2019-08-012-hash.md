# Maps

A map is an abstract data typ designed to effcientlry store and retrieve values based upon a uniquely identifying ***search key*** for each. Specifically, a map stores key-value pairs (k, v), which we call entries, where k is the key and v is its corresponding value. Keys are required to be unique, so that the association of keys to values defines a mapping.
