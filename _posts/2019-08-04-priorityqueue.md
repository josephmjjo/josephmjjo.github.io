Priority queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it.
I think you should use "Heap" when you implement Priority Queue . because stack and queue have cons.
stack has disadvantages that all of the values have to move if you add or remove values
cons of the queue are you can't find immediately location what you wish to remove or add 
So usually, we should use "Heap".
