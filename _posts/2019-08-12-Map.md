# Maps

A map is an abstract data typ designed to effcientlry store and retrieve values based upon a uniquely identifying ***search key*** for each. Specifically, a map stores key-value pairs (k, v), which we call entries, where k is the key and v is its corresponding value. Keys are required to be unique, so that the association of keys to values defines a mapping. 
Maps are also known as associative arrays, because the entry's key serves somewhat like an index into the map, in that it assists the map in effciently locating the associated entry.

### The Map ADT
since  a map stores a collection of objects, it should be viewed as a collection of key-value pairs. As an ADT, a map M supports the following methods:

- size()
- isEmpty()
- get(k)
- put(k, v)
- remove(k)
- keySet()
- values()
- entrySet()


### A Java Interface for the Map ADT

~~~
public interface Map<K,V> {
  int size();
  boolean isEmpty();
  V get(K key);
  v put(K key, V value);
  V remove(K key);
  Iterable<K> keySet();
  Iterable<V> values();
  Iterable<Entry<K, V>> entrySet();
}
~~~
